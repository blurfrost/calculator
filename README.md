# calculator
On-screen calculator created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript under guidance of The Odin Project

Functions:

1. Equal button
Pressing this button will evaluate up to a pair of numbers.

1. Number Pad
Pressing the inputs will cause numbers (0-9) to appear on the screen.

2. Operator Pad
Pressing the inputs for operators (+ - * / %) will cause them to appear on the screen. (Only one operator is allowed on screen due to the restriction of evaluating a pair of numbers) 

3. C/AC Buttons
You can use the C (clear) or AC (all clear) buttons to clear current input.

4. +/- Button
This button will allow you to make the first number in the pair to become a negative number. (When pressed again, the "-" in front will disappear)
The presence of the negative sign on the first number does not contribute to the character limit.

5. Error Messages
Due to the size of the calculator, the current character limit of the calculator is 18. 
Additionally, errenous forms of calculation (such as dividing by zero) will result in an error.
Pressing operator or number inputs will present an error message and prevent the operation from proceeding until C or AC is used.

Improvements to work on in the future:
- Implementation of a higher/unlimited character limit
