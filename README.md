# calculator
On-screen calculator created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript under guidance of The Odin Project

How to use:
Pressing the inputs will cause numbers (0-9) or operators (+ - * /) to appear on the screen.
You may evaluate 2 pairs of numbers using the calculator using the equals (=) button.
You can use the C (clear) or AC (all clear) buttons to clear current input.
Due to the size of the calculator, the current character limit of the calculator is 18. Pressing operator or number inputs will present an error message and prevent the operation from proceeding until C or AC is used.

Issues to work out in the future:
- Unable to evaluate negative numbers (due to hard restriction on number of operators to 1)
- Character limit
